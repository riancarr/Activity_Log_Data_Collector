#file used to display a UI which generates a list of users and games
#the list is in the form of a .txt file, which is then read in by generate_stats and used as input
#this input is in the form of dictionaries which fill up for stat collection purposes

#STEP 1: ask user for input
import tkinter as tk

#create the main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Enter name of Player.")




#STEP 2: sanatise input (all lowercase and append comma)

#STEP3: write into file (maybe add option to read and append to previous file in the future)



#run the file
root.mainloop()
